docker info   - docker info used for to check current configuration.Hoa many containers running and how many images are there..  ###  Docker Root Dir: /var/lib/docker (where docker data is stored physically.)

### Creating Docker images Step by step..

docker run ubantu - this command use for crate an image and if it is not find locally it will start pulling..
docker images - check wheather ubantu image created or not??
docker ps    - docker ps user for how many conatiner running inside iamage
docker ps -a - used for how many contanier are running and how many stopped container are there in image.

#### how to intract with containers

docker run -i -t ubuntu -->        this command use for how to go inside the container using docker image
hostname           --> using for which container is latest one..
docker run -i -t -d ubuntu    --> using this command to run the comtanier.  and this command will show the entire container id.. (this will run latest conatiner id of docker image)
docker exec -ti (docker exec -ti 5a727e8 bash) bash  -- if you want to go inside the perticular container .. (5a727e8 is container id)
docker start (docker start 4ffd0a00bcc5) --> to start the container  ## here 4ffd0a00bcc5 is the container id
docker stop (docker stop 4ffd0a00bcc5)--> to stop the docker container
docker kill (docker kill 4ffd00bc5) --> to kill the conatiner ..
docker rm (docker rm 4ffd0a00bcc5) --> Note: this command will work only for stopped containers.. if the container is running actively this command won't work.
docker rm -f (docker rm -f  4ffd0a00bcc5) --> Note: Don't use this command .this command will forcefully romove eaither it is running container also.
docker ps -aq --> using this command you will get all the conainers id's
docker stop $(docker ps -aq) --> this command is used for to stop the all the running containers
docker rm $(docker ps -aq)  --> this command used for to remove all the contaniners..
